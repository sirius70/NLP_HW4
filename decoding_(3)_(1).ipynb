        "# Language Model Decoding Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will implement several language model decoding algorithms, from simple greedy decoding to beam search. You will test these algorithms using GPT-2 as implemented in the huggingface `transformers` library. You will evaluate the results of an open-ended story generation task, where the goal is not to match a particular human-written reference text and more to generate text that is fluent and diverse. This gives more scope to different decoding approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `transformers` library implements most of these decoding algorithms, but you will be implementing them yourself using the capabilities of the underlying pytorch library.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code will benefit from running on a GPU.  If you're running on Colab, **choose \"Runtime Type\" = GPU for running this notebook (Runtime > Change Runtime Type > T4 GPU).**\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation and harness code for beam search is based on an earlier assignment by Jaehun Jung, Gary Jiacheng, and Yejin Choi from the University of Washington.\n",

        "Please make sure to run all cells in the setup section, even though you won't implement anything yet. First, we install the required libraries."

However, implementing it is much more complex than the intuition. While there are many “arbitrary” decisions one needs to make to implement beam search, for the purpose of this assignment, we will do the following:\n",

To update the hypothesis, we compute next token distribution $p_i$ for each hypothesis $h_i$, then take top-`beam_width` tokens (that makes the highest score when appended to the corresponding hypothesis) across all $p_i$s.\n",
        "\n",
        "* At each time step, in some of the hypotheses (say $h_1$), we may encounter the EOS token `<EOS>`. In greedy decoding, we can simply terminate the generation process, but in beam search, there still remain the 2 unfinished hypotheses. In this case, we move the finished hypothesis ($h_1$, which encountered the EOS token) into a separate list. For the remaining unfinished hypotheses $h_2$ and $h_3$, we keep searching for the best next tokens, retrieving the top `beam_width` = 3 tokens to create 3 new hypotheses (and their corresponding scores) for the next time step.\n",
