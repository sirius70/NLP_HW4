        "\n",
        "**Association Rule Mining** is a data mining technique used to discover meaningful relationships, patterns, and correlations among items in large datasets, typically transactional data. The primary goal is to generate **rules** that predict the occurrence of one or more items based on the presence of other items. This is widely used in market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and customer behavior analytics.\n",

        "1. **Itemset**  \n",
        "   - A collection of one or more items.\n",
        "   - **k-itemset**: An itemset containing exactly $(k)$ items.  \n",

Next, we analyzed the data by generating frequent itemsets and association rules, which showed how often certain items appear together. We then calculated metrics like support, confidence, and lift, which helped me understand how strong and meaningful each rule really is. Visualizing and sorting the rules made it easier to compare patterns and focus on the most interesting relationships.

We then flattened the data into a long format with transaction IDs, making it clear how individual items belong to each transaction. Using pd.crosstab(), we reshaped this data into a binary matrix, where each row represented a transaction and each column represented an item. This step helped me understand how one-hot encoding works behind the scenes without relying on external libraries. Comparing the manual result with the TransactionEncoder output showed that both approaches produce the same structure. Overall, this exercise made the encoding process feel more intuitive and helped me better understand how transactional data is prepared for association rule mining."

        "In this exercise, we started by preparing the transaction data and converting it into a binary format so it could be used by the Apriori algorithm. This step helped reinforce why proper data preparation is important before applying any data mining technique. We then applied the Apriori algorithm with a minimum support threshold, which showed how frequent itemsets are identified based on how often they appear in transactions. Sorting the results by support made it easy to see which items and item combinations were most common. From the output, it was clear that items like bread and milk are purchased very frequently, both alone and together. Overall, this exercise helped me understand how support values reflect real-world buying behavior and how Apriori can be used to find meaningful patterns in shopping data."

        "In this exercise, we reused the binary-encoded transaction data to see how Apriori behaves under different minimum support values. By running the algorithm with support levels of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, we could clearly see how lowering the support increases the number of frequent itemsets found. Counting itemsets of length two or more helped show how more complex combinations appear as the support threshold drops. The bar chart made this trend easy to understand by visually comparing results across support levels. This exercise also showed how the Apriori property helps prune the search space by eliminating itemsets early if their subsets are not frequent. Overall, I learned that higher support leads to fewer, simpler patterns, while lower support reveals more detailed but potentially noisier relationships."

        "The FP-Growth algorithm is an efficient alternative to Apriori for mining frequent itemsets, especially on large or dense datasets. Instead of generating candidate itemsets explicitly, FP-Growth builds a compressed data structure called an **FP-tree** (Frequent Pattern tree) that retains itemset frequency information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features of FP-Growth include:  \n",
        "- **Compact representation:** The FP-tree stores transactions in a prefix-tree structure, reducing memory usage.  \n",
        "- **Recursive mining:** Frequent itemsets are extracted by recursively examining conditional FP-trees without candidate generation.  \n",
        "- **Improved performance:** By avoiding candidate enumeration, FP-Growth runs faster on large datasets compared to Apriori.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is widely used in practice due to its scalability and efficiency.\n",

First, we applied Apriori to identify frequent itemsets with a minimum support of 0.2, then ran FP-Growth on the same dataset and support level. By comparing the results, we saw that both algorithms produced the same frequent itemsets and support values, showing that they identify patterns consistently. However, FP-Growth is more efficient because it doesn’t generate candidate itemsets, which makes it faster for larger datasets. This exercise helped me understand how FP-Growth uses an FP-tree to compress data and mine itemsets more efficiently. I also learned the importance of comparing algorithms to choose the best one based on dataset size and complexity. Overall, this reinforced my understanding of frequent itemset mining and how different algorithms can achieve the same goal in different ways."

First, we encoded the transactions into a binary format using TransactionEncoder to prepare the data for frequent itemset mining. Then, we ran both Apriori and FP-Growth with a minimum support of 0.05 and measured their runtime. Interestingly, both algorithms found the same number of frequent itemsets, but their execution times were different. This showed me that performance can vary depending on the dataset size and algorithm implementation. I learned how to benchmark algorithms and interpret results in terms of scalability and efficiency. Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm based on the dataset and performance requirements."

        "In this exercise, we used our encoded transaction dataset to generate association rules and evaluate them using support, confidence, and lift. First, we ran the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets that met a minimum support threshold. Then, we created rules from these itemsets and filtered them based on confidence to find strong patterns. Sorting the rules by lift helped us identify the most interesting relationships. For example, we saw that if a customer buys butter, they are likely to also buy milk, with support showing how common this pattern is, confidence indicating how reliable it is, and lift showing how much stronger the relationship is than random chance. This exercise taught me how these metrics work together to measure rule usefulness. Overall, I learned how to interpret association rules and understand which patterns are meaningful for decision-making in a shopping context."

Next, we used the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets and then generated association rules, which helped me see which items are commonly bought together. We applied thresholds for support, confidence, and lift to focus on the strongest and most meaningful rules. Using rule templates, we could look for specific patterns, like rules involving milk or butter, which made the analysis more targeted. Finally, interpreting the rules helped me understand customer behavior and how certain purchases are linked. Overall, I learned how each step, from data preparation to interpretation, builds on the previous one to turn raw data into actionable insights. This exercise showed me how association rules can be used to make recommendations or guide marketing decisions."

Next, we generated frequent itemsets and association rules to see which products were often bought together. We then applied a minimum length constraint to focus on rules with more complex patterns, which helped highlight stronger and more informative associations. Filtering and viewing metrics like support, confidence, and lift made it easier to identify the most meaningful rules. Finally, interpreting a rule, such as seeing that customers who buy butter and cheese also buy bread, helped me understand how these constraints reveal detailed customer behavior. Overall, this exercise showed me how each step, from data preparation to rule interpretation, builds a clear workflow to extract actionable insights. It also reinforced the importance of focusing on rules that are both relevant and easy to understand."

We then generated frequent itemsets and association rules to see which items were often bought together. Using rule templates, we filtered rules to focus on specific patterns, like rules where the antecedent contained both milk and bread or the consequent included butter. This helped us discover more targeted and meaningful relationships rather than looking at all possible rules. By interpreting the filtered rules, I could see, for example, that customers buying milk and bread were very likely to also buy butter. The bonus task, filtering rules where cheese appeared in the antecedent but butter did not appear in the consequent, showed me how to refine rules to find less obvious patterns. Overall, this exercise taught me how rule templates can make association rule analysis more focused, actionable, and easier to understand."

We then generated association rules and explored how to rank them using different metrics like support, confidence, and lift. Sorting the rules by each metric helped me understand how different measures highlight different “strong” rules, depending on whether we care about frequency, reliability, or interestingness. We also created a composite score to combine these metrics, which made it easier to identify the most useful rules overall. By comparing the top rules from each method, I learned how context and goals influence which rules are most valuable. This exercise taught me the importance of using multiple evaluation criteria to prioritize actionable insights from large sets of rules. Overall, it reinforced the idea that ranking and scoring are essential for making data-driven decisions."

We then applied basic pruning by removing rules with low confidence and lift, which helped focus on stronger and more reliable patterns. Next, we looked for redundant rules those that didn’t provide any new information compared to simpler rules with the same consequent and removed them to make the results cleaner and easier to interpret. By comparing the number of rules before and after pruning, I could clearly see how much redundancy exists in raw rule sets. Finally, we interpreted a strong retained rule, which showed that customers who buy butter are very likely to also buy bread. This exercise taught me the importance of pruning: it makes rule sets more actionable, reduces noise, and highlights the most useful insights for decision-making. Overall, I learned that carefully refining rules is just as important as generating them."
